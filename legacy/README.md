# Legacy static pages

This folder contains the old static site pages and scripts that were previously used before the React migration. They are not part of the current React app under `src/` and are kept here for archival/reference purposes.

Contents:
- `services.html` — Old services page (standalone HTML)
- `contact.html` — Old contact page (standalone HTML)
- `main.js` — Utility script used by the old static pages

Notes:
- These files are not referenced by the React app and won’t be included in the production build.
- To preview them, open the HTML files directly in your browser (they reference scripts that now live in this folder only).
